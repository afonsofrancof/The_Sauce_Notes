## Ex. 1
a)
> [!help]- What is the complexity of the MM (i.e., in big O notation, where N is the problem size and NxN is the matrix size)?
> O()

>[!hint]- Big O Notation Cheat Sheet
>- Constant: O(1)
>- Linear time: O(n)
>- Logarithmic time: O(n log n)
>- Quadratic time: O(n^2)
>- Exponential time: O(2^n)
>- Factorial time: O(n!)

>[!help]- What increase in execution time is expected when the N doubles?

>[!help]- Which component of the performance equation is affected (e.g., \#I, CPI or Tcc)?
